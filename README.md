# Right-Barrel-Shifter
This project implements an 8-bit barrel shifter using Verilog HDL and is deployed on the Basys 3 FPGA development board. The barrel shifter performs a right rotation (circular shift) of the input bits based on a 3-bit shift amount. The design is tested and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado, and the output is displayed via LEDs on the Basys 3 board.
